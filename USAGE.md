# STARTTLS Policy List Usage Guidelines

For information about configuration of receiving mailservers and addition of a receiving mailserver to the list, please see [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) instead.

## MTA-STS interoperation for sending mailservers

The ideal is for the STARTTLS policy list to act as a "preload list" for MTA-STS domains. Although there are many parallels to the web situation with HSTS and the HSTS preload list, this list is not an exact equivalent. There are a couple of edge cases to consider when implementing both MTA-STS and the policy list. This describes the expected behavior of **sending** mailservers that both validate MTA-STS and follow the policy list.

If a mailserver is able to successfully discover and validate an MTA-STS record that conflicts with a policy on the list, then the mailserver should use the MTA-STS policy. Similarly, if a mailserver has an MTA-STS record cached that conflicts with a policy on the list, then the mailserver should use the MTA-STS policy.

That is, MTA-STS should take precedence over the STARTTLS policy list. The primary benefit of the STARTTLS policy list with MTA-STS is to secure MTA-STS on first-use.


## Using the list

To download and verify the most up-to-date version of the STARTTLS policy list:

```
wget https://dl.eff.org/starttls-everywhere/policy.json
wget https://dl.eff.org/starttls-everywhere/policy.json.asc
gpg --recv-key B693F33372E965D76D55368616EEA65D03326C9D
gpg --trusted-key 842AEA40C5BCD6E1 --verify policy.json.asc
```

Our sample [update_and_verify.sh script](https://github.com/EFForg/starttls-everywhere/blob/master/scripts/update_and_verify.sh) does the same. If you are actively using the list, **you must fetch updates at least once every 48 hours**. We provide [a sample cronjob](https://github.com/EFForg/starttls-everywhere/blob/master/scripts/starttls-policy.cron.d) to do this.

Every policy JSON has an expiry date in the top-level configuration, after which we cannot guarantee deliverability if you are using the expired list.

#### Behavior

A domain's policy, `enforce` or `testing`, asks that relays which connect to that domain's MX server and cannot initiate a TLS connection perform different behaviors depending on the policy (e.g. reporting what went wrong to the target domain for `testing`, and additionally aborting the connection for `enforce`). That is the behavior specified by [SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8461), an upcoming protocol which this Policy List aims to complement by providing an alternative method for advertising a mail serverâ€™s security policy.

#### Tooling

Our [starttls-policy](https://github.com/EFForg/starttls-everywhere/tree/master/starttls-policy) Python package can fetch updates to and iterate over the existing list. If you use Postfix, we provide utilities to transform the policy list into configuration parameters that Postfix understands.
